2. **Replace the existing images** in the `docs/screenshots/` directory with the same filenames
3. **Update this README** if you add new screenshots or change the structure
4. **Test that images display correctly** in the main README

**Current Status**: ✅ All screenshots are in place and displaying correctly in the main README

## 📚 Usage

These screenshots are automatically displayed in the main project README.md file. The images are referenced using relative paths, so they work both on GitHub and when viewing the repository locally.
